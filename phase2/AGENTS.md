# **AGENTS.md**
## **Purpose**
This project uses **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** — a workflow where **no agent is allowed to
write code until the specification is complete and approved**.
All AI agents (Claude, Copilot, Gemini, local LLMs, etc.) must follow the **Spec-Kit lifecycle**:
> **Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement**
This prevents “vibe coding,” ensures alignment across agents, and guarantees that every
implementation step maps back to an explicit requirement.

## Project Overview
**Todo App - Hackathon II**
This is a monorepo using GitHub Spec-Kit for spec-driven development.

## Project Structure
- `/frontend` - Next.js 14 app
- `/backend` - Python FastAPI server
- `/specs` - Organized specifications
- `speckit.constitution` - Project rules and constraints

## Spec-Kit Structure
Specifications are organized in `/specs`:
- `/specs/overview.md` - Project overview
- `/specs/features/` - Feature specs (what to build)
- `/specs/api/` - API endpoint and MCP tool specs
- `/specs/database/` - Schema and model specs
- `/specs/ui/` - Component and page specs

## **How Agents Must Work**
Every agent in this project MUST obey these rules:
1. **Never generate code without a referenced Task ID.**
2. **Never modify architecture without updating `speckit.plan`.**
3. **Never propose features without updating `speckit.specify` (WHAT).**
4. **Never change approach without updating `speckit.constitution` (Principles).**
5. **Every code file must contain a comment linking it to the Task and Spec sections.**
If an agent cannot find the required spec, it must **stop and request it**, not improvise.
---
## **Spec-Kit Workflow (Source of Truth)**
### **1. Constitution (WHY — Principles & Constraints)**
File: `speckit.constitution`
Defines the project’s non-negotiables: architecture values, security rules, tech stack constraints,
performance expectations, and patterns allowed.
Agents must check this before proposing solutions.
---
### **2. Specify (WHAT — Requirements, Journeys & Acceptance Criteria)**
File: `speckit.specify`
Contains:
* User journeys
* Requirements
* Acceptance criteria
* Domain rules
* Business constraints
Agents must not infer missing requirements — they must request clarification or propose
specification updates.
---
### **3. Plan (HOW — Architecture, Components, Interfaces)**
File: `speckit.plan`
Includes:
* Component breakdown
* APIs & schema diagrams
* Service boundaries
* System responsibilities
* High-level sequencing

All architectural output MUST be generated from the Specify file.
---
### **4. Tasks (BREAKDOWN — Atomic, Testable Work Units)**
File: `speckit.tasks`
Each Task must contain:
* Task ID
* Clear description
* Preconditions
* Expected outputs
* Artifacts to modify
* Links back to Specify + Plan sections
Agents **implement only what these tasks define**.
---
### **5. Implement (CODE — Write Only What the Tasks Authorize)**
Agents now write code, but must:
* Reference Task IDs
* Follow the Plan exactly
* Not invent new features or flows
* Stop and request clarification if anything is underspecified
> The golden rule: **No task = No code.**
---
## Development Workflow
1. **Read spec:** `@specs/features/[feature].md`
2. **Implement backend:** `@backend/CLAUDE.md`
3. **Implement frontend:** `@frontend/CLAUDE.md`
4. **Test and iterate**

---

### **Commands**:

**Frontend**: cd frontend && npm run dev

**Backend**: cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload

**Both**: docker-compose up

## How to Use Specs
1. Always read relevant spec before implementing
2. Reference specs with: `@specs/features/task-crud.md`
3. Update specs if requirements change

## **Agent Behavior in This Project**
### **When generating code:**
Agents must reference:
```
[Task]: T-001
[From]: speckit.specify §2.1, speckit.plan §3.4
```
### **When proposing architecture:**
Agents must reference:

```
Update required in speckit.plan → add component X
```
### **When proposing new behavior or a new feature:**
Agents must reference:
```
Requires update in speckit.specify (WHAT)
```
### **When changing principles:**
Agents must reference:
```
Modify constitution.md → Principle #X
```

---
## **Agent Failure Modes (What Agents MUST Avoid)**
Agents are NOT allowed to:
* Freestyle code or architecture
* Generate missing requirements
* Create tasks on their own
* Alter stack choices without justification
* Add endpoints, fields, or flows that aren’t in the spec
* Ignore acceptance criteria
* Produce “creative” implementations that violate the plan
If a conflict arises between spec files, the **Constitution > Specify > Plan > Tasks** hierarchy
applies.
---
## **Developer–Agent Alignment**
Humans and agents collaborate, but the **spec is the single source of truth**.
Before every session, agents should re-read:
1. `.memory/constitution.md`
This ensures predictable, deterministic development
